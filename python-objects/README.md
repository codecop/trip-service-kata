Trip Service Kata Python
========================

Since the original is from Java, this is a mechanical translation to Python.

If you want to give it a go, the starting point is [TripServiceTest.py][3] and [TripService.py][4]. Try unit testing it following the rules outlined in the main readme.

For future comparisons, when you are done, you can always check [TripService_Original.py][2].
