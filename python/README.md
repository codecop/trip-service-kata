Trip Service Kata Python
========================

Since the original is from Java, this is an idiomatic python translation.

It is recommended that you use the idiomatic translation when trying this kata in Python.
If you want to give it a go, the starting point is [tripservice.py][4]. Try unit testing it following the rules outlined in the main readme.

For future comparisons, when you are done, you can always check [tripservice_original.py][2].
